## Objective

To define an industry standard “Container Storage Interface” (CSI) that will enable storage vendors (SP) to develop a plugin once and have it work across a number of container orchestration (CO) systems.

### Goals in MVP

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) will

* Enable SP authors to write one CSI compliant Plugin that “just works” across all COs that implement CSI.
* Define API (RPCs) that enable:
  * Dynamic provisioning and deprovisioning of a volume.
  * Attaching or detaching a volume from a node.
  * Mounting/unmounting a volume from a node.
  * Consumption of both block and mountable volumes.
  * Local storage providers (e.g., device mapper, lvm).
* Define plugin protocol RECOMMENDATIONS.
  * Describe a process by which a Supervisor configures a Plugin.
  * Container deployment considerations (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, mount namespace, etc.).

### Non-Goals in MVP

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) explicitly will not define, provide, or dictate in v0.1:

* Specific mechanisms by which a Plugin Supervisor manages the lifecycle of a Plugin, including:
  * How to maintain state (e.g. what is attached, mounted, etc.).
  * How to deploy, install, upgrade, uninstall, monitor, or respawn (in case of unexpected termination) Plugins.
* A first class message structure/field to represent "grades of storage" (aka "storage class").
* Protocol-level authentication and authorization.
* Packaging of a Plugin.
* POSIX compliance: CSI provides no guarantee that volumes provided are POSIX compliant filesystems.
  Compliance is determined by the Plugin implementation (and any backend storage system(s) upon which it depends).
  CSI SHALL NOT obstruct a Plugin Supervisor or CO from interacting with Plugin-managed volumes in a POSIX-compliant manner.

## Solution Overview

This specification defines an interface along with the minimum operational and packaging recommendations for a storage provider (SP) to implement a CSI compatible plugin.
The interface declares the RPCs that a plugin must expose: this is the **primary focus** of the CSI specification.
Any operational and packaging recommendations offer additional guidance to promote cross-CO compatibility.

### Architecture

The primary focus of this specification is on the **protocol** between a CO and a Plugin.
It SHOULD be possible to ship cross-CO compatible Plugins for a variety of deployment architectures.
A CO should be equipped to handle both centralized and headless plugins, as well as split-component and unified plugins.
Several of these possibilities are illustrated in the following figures.

```

them via the capabilities API. Interactions with the volumes of such
plugins is reduced to `NodePublishVolume` and `NodeUnpublishVolume`
calls.
```

The above diagrams illustrate a general expectation with respect to how a CO MAY manage the lifecycle of a volume via the API presented in this specification.
Plugins should expose all RPCs for an interface: Controller plugins should implement all RPCs for the `Controller` service.
Unsupported RPCs should return an appropriate error code that indicates such (e.g. `CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`).
The full list of plugin capabilities is documented in the `ControllerGetCapabilities` and `NodeGetCapabilities` RPCs.

## Container Storage Interface

This section describes the interface between COs and Plugins.

### RPC Interface

A CO interacts with an Plugin through RPCs.
Each SP MUST provide:

* **Node Plugin**: A gRPC endpoint serving CSI RPCs that MUST be run on the Node whereupon an SP-provisioned volume will be published.
* **Controller Plugin**: A gRPC endpoint serving CSI RPCs that MAY be run anywhere.
* In some circumstances a single gRPC endpoint MAY serve all CSI RPCs (see Figure 3 in [Architecture](#architecture)).

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package csi;
```

There are three sets of RPCs:

* **Identity Service**: Both the Node Plugin and the Controller Plugin MUST implement this sets of RPCs.
* **Controller Service**: The Controller Plugin MUST implement this sets of RPCs.
* **Node Service**: The Node Plugin MUST implement this sets of RPCs.

```protobuf
service Identity {
  rpc GetSupportedVersions (GetSupportedVersionsRequest)
    returns (GetSupportedVersionsResponse) {}

  rpc GetPluginInfo(GetPluginInfoRequest)
    returns (GetPluginInfoResponse) {}
}

service Controller {
  rpc CreateVolume (CreateVolumeRequest)
    returns (CreateVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc DeleteVolume (DeleteVolumeRequest)
    returns (DeleteVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc ControllerPublishVolume (ControllerPublishVolumeRequest)
    returns (ControllerPublishVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc ControllerUnpublishVolume (ControllerUnpublishVolumeRequest)
    returns (ControllerUnpublishVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc ValidateVolumeCapabilities (ValidateVolumeCapabilitiesRequest)
    returns (ValidateVolumeCapabilitiesResponse) {}

  rpc ListVolumes (ListVolumesRequest)
    returns (ListVolumesResponse) {}

  rpc GetCapacity (GetCapacityRequest)
    returns (GetCapacityResponse) {}

  rpc ControllerGetCapabilities (ControllerGetCapabilitiesRequest)
    returns (ControllerGetCapabilitiesResponse) {}  
}

service Node {
  rpc NodePublishVolume (NodePublishVolumeRequest)
    returns (NodePublishVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc NodeUnpublishVolume (NodeUnpublishVolumeRequest)
    returns (NodeUnpublishVolumeResponse) {}

  rpc GetNodeID (GetNodeIDRequest)
    returns (GetNodeIDResponse) {}

  rpc ProbeNode (ProbeNodeRequest)
    returns (ProbeNodeResponse) {}

  rpc NodeGetCapabilities (NodeGetCapabilitiesRequest)
    returns (NodeGetCapabilitiesResponse) {}
}
```

In general the Cluster Orchestrator (CO) is responsible for ensuring that there is no more than one call “in-flight” per volume at a given time.
However, in some circumstances, the CO may lose state (for example when the CO crashes and restarts), and may issue multiple calls simultaneously for the same volume.
The plugin should handle this as gracefully as possible.
The error code `OPERATION_PENDING_FOR_VOLUME` may be returned by the plugin in this case (see general error code section for details).

### Identity Service RPC

Identity service RPCs allow a CO to negotiate an API protocol version that MAY be used for subsequent RPCs across all CSI services with respect to a particular CSI plugin.
The general flow of the success case is as follows (protos illustrated in YAML for brevity):

1. CO queries supported versions via Identity RPC. The CO is expected to gracefully handle, in the manner of its own choosing, the case wherein the returned `supported_versions` from the plugin are not supported by the CO.

```
   # CO --(GetSupportedVersions)--> Plugin
   request: {}
   response:
     result:
       supported_versions:
         - major: 0
           minor: 1
           patch: 0
```

2. CO queries metadata via Identity RPC, using a supported API protocol version (as per the reply from the prior step): the requested `version` MUST match an entry from the aforementioned `supported_versions` array.

```
   # CO --(GetPluginInfo)--> Plugin
   request:
     version:
       major: 0
       minor: 1
       patch: 0
   response:
     result:
       name: org.foo.whizbang/super-plugin
       vendor_version: blue-green
       manifest:
         baz: qaz
```

#### `GetSupportedVersions`

A Plugin SHALL reply with a list of supported CSI versions.
The initial version of the CSI specification is 0.1.0 (in *major.minor.patch* format).
A CO MAY execute plugin RPCs in the manner prescribed by any such supported CSI version.
The versions returned by this call are orthogonal to any vendor-specific version metadata (see `vendor_version` in `GetPluginInfoResponse`).

NOTE: Changes to this RPC should be approached very conservatively since the request/response protobufs here are critical for proper client-server version negotiation.
Future changes to this RPC MUST **guarantee** backwards compatibility.

```protobuf
message GetSupportedVersionsRequest {
}

message GetSupportedVersionsResponse {
  message Result {
    // All the CSI versions that the Plugin supports. This field is
    // REQUIRED.
    repeated Version supported_versions = 1;
  }

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}

// Specifies a version in Semantic Version 2.0 format.
// (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
message Version {
  uint32 major = 1;  // This field is REQUIRED.
  uint32 minor = 2;  // This field is REQUIRED.
  uint32 patch = 3;  // This field is REQUIRED.
}
```

#### `GetPluginInfo`

```protobuf
message GetPluginInfoRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;
}

message GetPluginInfoResponse {
  message Result {
    // This field is REQUIRED.
    string name = 1;

    // This field is REQUIRED. Value of this field is opaque to the CO.
    string vendor_version = 2;

    // This field is OPTIONAL. Values are opaque to the CO.
    map<string, string> manifest = 3;
  }

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

### Controller Service RPC

#### `CreateVolume`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME` controller capability.
This RPC will be called by the CO to provision a new volume on behalf of a user (to be consumed as either a block device or a mounted filesystem).
This operation MUST be idempotent.

```protobuf
message CreateVolumeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This field is REQUIRED.
  Version version = 1;

  // The suggested name for the storage space. This field is REQUIRED.
  // It serves two purposes:
  // 1) Idempotency - This name is generated by the CO to achieve 
  //    idempotency. If `CreateVolume` fails, the volume may or may not
  //    be provisioned. In this case, the CO may call `CreateVolume`
  //    again, with the same name, to ensure the volume exists. The
  //    Plugin should ensure that multiple `CreateVolume` calls for the
  //    same name do not result in more than one piece of storage
  //    provisioned corresponding to that name. If a Plugin is unable to
  //    enforce idempotency, the CO’s error recovery logic could result
  //    in multiple (unused) volumes being provisioned.
  // 2) Suggested name - Some storage systems allow callers to specify
  //    an identifier by which to refer to the newly provisioned
  //    storage. If a storage system supports this, it can optionally
  //    use this name as the identifier for the new volume.
  string name = 2;

  // This field is OPTIONAL. This allows the CO to specify the capacity
  // requirement of the volume to be provisioned. If not specified, the
  // Plugin MAY choose an implementation-defined capacity range.
  CapacityRange capacity_range = 3;

  // The capabilities that the provisioned volume MUST have: the Plugin
  // MUST provision a volume that could satisfy ALL of the
  // capabilities specified in this list. The Plugin MUST assume that
  // the CO MAY use the  provisioned volume later with ANY of the
  // capabilities specified in this list. This also enables the CO to do
  // early validation: if ANY of the specified volume capabilities are
  // not supported by the Plugin, the call SHALL fail. This field is
  // REQUIRED.
  repeated VolumeCapability volume_capabilities = 4;
    
  // Plugin specific parameters passed in as opaque key-value pairs.
  // This field is OPTIONAL. The Plugin is responsible for parsing and
  // validating these parameters. COs will treat these as opaque.
  map<string, string> parameters = 5;
}

message CreateVolumeResponse {
  message Result {
    // Contains all attributes of the newly created volume that are
    // relevant to the CO along with information required by the Plugin
    // to uniquely identifying the volume. This field is REQUIRED.
    VolumeInfo volume_info = 1;
  }

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}

// Specify a capability of a volume.
message VolumeCapability {
  // Indicate that the volume will be accessed via the block device API.
  message BlockVolume {
    // Intentionally empty, for now.
  }

  // Indicate that the volume will be accessed via the filesystem API.
  message MountVolume {
    // The filesystem type. This field is OPTIONAL.
    string fs_type = 1;

    // The mount options that can be used for the volume. This field is
    // OPTIONAL. `mount_flags` MAY contain sensitive information.
    // Therefore, the CO and the Plugin MUST NOT leak this information
    // to untrusted entities.
    repeated string mount_flags = 2;    
  }

  // Specify how a volume can be accessed.
  message AccessMode {
    enum Mode {
      UNKNOWN = 0;

      // Can be published as read/write at one node at a time.
      SINGLE_NODE_WRITER = 1;

      // Can be published as readonly at one node at a time.
      SINGLE_NODE_READER_ONLY = 2;

      // Can be published as readonly at multiple nodes simultaneously.
      MULTI_NODE_READER_ONLY = 3;

      // Can be published at multiple nodes simultaneously. Only one of
      // the node can be used as read/write. The rest will be readonly.
      MULTI_NODE_SINGLE_WRITER = 4;

      // Can be published as read/write at multiple nodes simultaneously.
      MULTI_NODE_MULTI_WRITER = 5;
    }

    // This field is REQUIRED.
    Mode mode = 1;
  }

  // Specifies what API the volume will be accessed using. One of the
  // following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof access_type {
    BlockVolume block = 1;
    MountVolume mount = 2;
  }

  // This is a REQUIRED field.
  AccessMode access_mode = 3;
}

// The capacity of the storage space in bytes. To specify an exact size,
// `required_bytes` and `limit_bytes` can be set to the same value. At
// least one of the these fields MUST be specified.
message CapacityRange {
  // Volume must be at least this big. 
  uint64 required_bytes = 1;

  // Volume must not be bigger than this.
  uint64 limit_bytes = 2;
}

// The information about a provisioned volume.
message VolumeInfo {
  // The capacity of the volume in bytes. This field is OPTIONAL. If not
  // set, it indicates that the capacity of the volume is unknown (e.g.,
  // NFS share). If set, it MUST be non-zero.
  uint64 capacity_bytes = 1;

  // Contains identity information for the created volume. This field is  
  // REQUIRED. The identity information will be used by the CO in
  // subsequent calls to refer to the provisioned volume.
  VolumeID id = 4;

  // Metadata of the created volume. This field is OPTIONAL. If set, the
  // CO SHALL pass this information along with the `id` to subsequent
  // calls.
  VolumeMetadata metadata = 5;
}

// The identity of the volume.
message VolumeID {
  // The identity of the provisioned volume specified by the Plugin in
  // the form of key-value pairs. This field is REQUIRED. Given this
  // information will be passed around by the CO, it is RECOMMENDED that
  // each Plugin keeps this information as small as possible.
  map<string, string> values = 1;
}

// The metadata information about the volume.
message VolumeMetadata {
  // The metadata information about the provisioned volume specified by
  // the Plugin in the form of key-value pairs. This field is OPTIONAL.
  // This field MAY contain sensitive information. Therefore, the CO
  // MUST NOT leak this information to untrusted entities. Given this
  // information will be passed around by the CO, it is RECOMMENDED that
  // each Plugin keeps this information as small as possible.
  map<string, string> values = 1;
}
```

#### `DeleteVolume`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME` capability.
This RPC will be called by the CO to deprovision a volume.
If successful, the storage space associated with the volume MUST be released and all the data in the volume SHALL NOT be accessible anymore.

This operation MUST be idempotent.
This operation SHOULD be best effort in the sense that if the Plugin is certain that the volume as well as the artifacts associated with the volume do not exist anymore, it SHOULD return a success.

```protobuf
message DeleteVolumeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This field is REQUIRED.
  Version version = 1;

  // The ID of the volume to be deprovisioned. This field is REQUIRED.
  VolumeID volume_id = 2;

  // The metadata of the volume to be deprovisioned. This field is
  // OPTIONAL.
  VolumeMetadata volume_metadata = 3;
}

message DeleteVolumeResponse {
  message Result {}

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

#### `ControllerPublishVolume`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME` controller capability.
This RPC will be called by the CO when it wants to place a workload that uses the volume onto a node.
The Plugin SHOULD perform the work that is necessary for making the volume available on the given node.
The Plugin MUST NOT assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume will be used.

This operation MUST be idempotent.
If the operation failed or the CO does not know if the operation has failed or not, it MAY choose to call `ControllerPublishVolume` again or choose to call `ControllerUnpublishVolume`.

The CO MAY call this RPC for publishing a volume to multiple nodes if the volume has `MULTI_NODE` capability (i.e., `MULTI_NODE_READER_ONLY`, `MULTI_NODE_SINGLE_WRITER` or `MULTI_NODE_MULTI_WRITER`).

```protobuf
message ControllerPublishVolumeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This field is REQUIRED.

#### `ControllerUnpublishVolume`

Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME` controller capability.
This RPC is a reverse operation of `ControllerPublishVolume`.
It MUST be called after `NodeUnpublishVolume` on the volume is called and succeeds.
The Plugin SHOULD perform the work that is necessary for making the volume ready to be consumed by a different node.
The Plugin MUST NOT assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume was previously used.

This RPC is typically called by the CO when the workload using the volume is being moved to a different node, or all the workload using the volume on a node has finished.

This operation MUST be idempotent.
If this operation failed, or the CO does not know if the operation failed or not, it can choose to call `ControllerUnpublishVolume` again.

```protobuf
message ControllerUnpublishVolumeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This field is REQUIRED.
  Version version = 1;

  // The ID of the volume. This field is REQUIRED.
  VolumeID volume_id = 2;

  // `GetNodeID` is allowed to omit `NodeID` from a successful `Result`;
  // in such cases the CO SHALL NOT specify this field.
  //
  // If `GetNodeID` does not omit `NodeID` from a successful `Result`,
  // the CO MAY omit this field as well, indicating that it does not
  // know which node the volume was previously used. The Plugin SHOULD
  // return an Error if this is not supported.

```

#### `ValidateVolumeCapabilities`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
This RPC will be called by the CO to check if a pre-provisioned volume has all the capabilities that the CO wants.
This RPC call SHALL return `supported` only if all the volume capabilities specified in the request are supported.
This operation MUST be idempotent.

```protobuf
message ValidateVolumeCapabilitiesRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;

  // The information about the volume to check. This is a REQUIRED
  // field. 
  VolumeInfo volume_info = 2;

#### `ListVolumes`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `LIST_VOLUMES` capability.
The Plugin SHALL return the information about all the volumes that it knows about.

```protobuf
message ListVolumesRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This field is REQUIRED.
  Version version = 1;

  // If specified, the Plugin MUST NOT return more entries than this
  // number in the response. If the actual number of entries is more
  // than this number, the Plugin MUST set `next_token` in the response
  // which can be used to get the next page of entries in the subsequent
  // `ListVolumes` call. This field is OPTIONAL. If not specified, it
  // means there is no restriction on the number of entries that can be

  }

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

#### `GetCapacity`

A Controller Plugin MUST implement this RPC call if it has `GET_CAPACITY` controller capability.
The RPC allows the CO to query the capacity of the storage pool from which the controller provisions volumes.

```protobuf
message GetCapacityRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;

  // If specified, the Plugin SHALL report the capacity of the storage
  // that can be used to provision volumes that satisfy ALL of the

  repeated VolumeCapability volume_capabilities = 2;

  // If specified, the Plugin SHALL report the capacity of the storage
  // that can be used to provision volumes with the given Plugin
  // specific `parameters`. These are the same `parameters` the CO will

  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;
}

message ControllerGetCapabilitiesResponse {
  message Result {
    // All the capabilities that the controller service supports. This

```

### Node Service RPC

#### `NodePublishVolume`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
This RPC is typically called by the CO when it wants to place a workload that wants to use the volume on a node.
The Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume will be used.
If the corresponding Controller Plugin has `PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME` controller capability, the CO MUST guarantee that this RPC is called after `ControllerPublishVolume` is called for the given volume on the given node and returns a success.

This operation MUST be idempotent.
If this RPC failed, or the CO does not know if it failed or not, it MAY choose to call `NodePublishVolume` again, or choose to call `NodeUnpublishVolume`.

```protobuf
message NodePublishVolumeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;

  // The ID of the volume to publish. This field is REQUIRED.
  VolumeID volume_id = 2;

  // The metadata of the volume to publish. This field is OPTIONAL.
  VolumeMetadata volume_metadata = 3;

  // The CO SHALL set this field to the value returned by 
  // `ControllerPublishVolume` if the corresponding Controller Plugin
  // has `PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME` controller capability, and SHALL be
  // left unset if the corresponding Controller Plugin does not have
  // this capability. This is an OPTIONAL field.
  PublishVolumeInfo publish_volume_info = 4;

  // The path to which the volume will be published. It MUST be an
  // absolute path in the root filesystem of the process serving this
  // request. This is a REQUIRED field.
  string target_path = 5;

  // The capability of the volume the CO expects the volume to have.
  // This is a REQUIRED field.

  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

#### `NodeUnpublishVolume`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
This RPC is a reverse operation of `NodePublishVolume`.
If the corresponding Controller Plugin has `PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME` controller capability, the CO MUST guarantee that this RPC is called before `ControllerUnpublishVolume` is called for the given node and the given volume.
The Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume is being used.

This RPC is typically called by the CO when the workload using the volume is being moved to a different node, or all the workload using the volume on a node has finished.

This operation MUST be idempotent.
If this RPC failed, or the CO does not know if it failed or not, it can choose to call `NodeUnpublishVolume` again.

```protobuf

  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

#### `GetNodeID`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
The Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume will be used.
The CO SHOULD call this RPC for the node at which it wants to place the workload.
The result of this call will be used by CO in `ControllerPublishVolume`.

```protobuf
message GetNodeIDRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;
}

message GetNodeIDResponse {
  message Result {
    // The ID of the node which SHALL be used by CO in

```

#### `ProbeNode`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
The Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where the volume will be used.
The CO SHOULD call this RPC for the node at which it wants to place the workload.
This RPC allows the CO to probe the readiness of the Plugin on the node where the volumes will be used.
The Plugin SHOULD verify if it has everything it needs (binaries, kernel module, drivers, etc.) to run on that node, and return a success if the validation succeeds.
The CO MAY use this RPC to probe which machines can support specific Plugins and schedule workloads accordingly.

```protobuf
message ProbeNodeRequest {
  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;
}

message ProbeNodeResponse {
  message Result {}

  // One of the following fields MUST be specified.
  oneof reply {
    Result result = 1;
    Error error = 2;
  }
}
```

#### `NodeGetCapabilities`

A Node Plugin MUST implement this RPC call.
This RPC allows the CO to check the supported capabilities of node service provided by the Plugin.

```protobuf

  // The API version assumed by the CO. This is a REQUIRED field.
  Version version = 1;
}

message NodeGetCapabilitiesResponse {
  message Result {
    // All the capabilities that the node service supports. This field
    // is OPTIONAL.

  }
  
  oneof type {
    // RPC that the controller supports.
    RPC rpc = 1;
  }
}
```

### Error Type/Codes

Standard error types that Plugins MUST reply with.
Allows CO to implement smarter error handling and fault resolution.

```protobuf

  // General Error that MAY be returned by any RPC.
  message GeneralError {

## Protocol

### Connectivity

* A CO SHALL communicate with a Plugin using gRPC to access the `Identity`, and (optionally) the `Controller` and `Node` services.
  * proto3 SHOULD be used with gRPC, as per the [official recommendations](http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/#protocol-buffer-versions).
  * All Plugins SHALL implement the REQUIRED Identity service RPCs.
    Support for OPTIONAL RPCs is reported by the `ControllerGetCapabilities` and `NodeGetCapabilities` RPC calls.
* The CO SHALL provide the listen-address for the Plugin by way of the `CSI_ENDPOINT` environment variable.
  Plugin components SHALL create, bind, and listen for RPCs on the specified listen address.
  * Only UNIX Domain Sockets may be used as endpoints.
    This will likely change in a future version of this specification to support non-UNIX platforms.
* All supported RPC services MUST be available at the listen address of the Plugin.

### Security

* The CO operator and Plugin Supervisor SHOULD take steps to ensure that any and all communication between the CO and Plugin Service are secured according to best practices.
* Communication between a CO and a Plugin SHALL be transported over UNIX Domain Sockets.
  * gRPC is compatible with UNIX Domain Sockets; it is the responsibility of the CO operator and Plugin Supervisor to properly secure access to the Domain Socket using OS filesystem ACLs and/or other OS-specific security context tooling.
  * SP’s supplying stand-alone Plugin controller appliances, or other remote components that are incompatible with UNIX Domain Sockets must provide a software component that proxies communication between a UNIX Domain Socket and the remote component(s).
    Proxy components transporting communication over IP networks SHALL be responsible for securing communications over such networks.
* Both the CO and Plugin SHOULD avoid accidental leakage of sensitive information (such as redacting such information from log files).

### Debugging

* Debugging and tracing are supported by external, CSI-independent additions and extensions to gRPC APIs, such as [OpenTracing](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-opentracing).

## Configuration and Operation

### General Configuration

* The `CSI_ENDPOINT` environment variable SHALL be supplied to the Plugin by the Plugin Supervisor.
* An operator SHALL configure the CO to connect to the Plugin via the listen address identified by `CSI_ENDPOINT` variable.
* With exception to sensitive data, Plugin configuration SHOULD be specified by environment variables, whenever possible, instead of by command line flags or bind-mounted/injected files.


#### Plugin Bootstrap Example

* Supervisor -> Plugin: `CSI_ENDPOINT=unix://path/to/unix/domain/socket.sock`.
* Operator -> CO: use plugin at endpoint `unix://path/to/unix/domain/socket.sock`.
* CO: monitor `/path/to/unix/domain/socket.sock`.
* Plugin: read `CSI_ENDPOINT`, create UNIX socket at specified path, bind and listen.
* CO: observe that socket now exists, establish connection.
* CO: invoke `GetSupportedVersions`.

#### Filesystem

* Plugins SHALL NOT specify requirements that include or otherwise reference directories and/or files on the root filesystem of the CO.
* Plugins SHALL NOT create additional files or directories adjacent to the UNIX socket specified by `CSI_ENDPOINT`; violations of this requirement constitute "abuse".
  * The Plugin Supervisor is the ultimate authority of the directory in which the UNIX socket endpoint is created and MAY enforce policies to prevent and/or mitigate abuse of the directory by Plugins.

### Supervised Lifecycle Management

* For Plugins packaged in software form:
  * Plugin Packages SHOULD use a well-documented container image format (e.g., Docker, OCI).
  * The chosen package image format MAY expose configurable Plugin properties as environment variables, unless otherwise indicated in the section below.
    Variables so exposed SHOULD be assigned default values in the image manifest.
  * A Plugin Supervisor MAY programmatically evaluate or otherwise scan a Plugin Package’s image manifest in order to discover configurable environment variables.
  * A Plugin SHALL NOT assume that an operator or Plugin Supervisor will scan an image manifest for environment variables.

#### Environment Variables

* Variables defined by this specification SHALL be identifiable by their `CSI_` name prefix.
* Configuration properties not defined by the CSI specification SHALL NOT use the same `CSI_` name prefix; this prefix is reserved for common configuration properties defined by the CSI specification.
* The Plugin Supervisor SHOULD supply all recommended CSI environment variables to a Plugin.
* The Plugin Supervisor SHALL supply all required CSI environment variables to a Plugin.

##### `CSI_ENDPOINT`

Network endpoint at which a Plugin SHALL host CSI RPC services. The general format is:

    {scheme}://{authority}{endpoint}

The following address types SHALL be supported by Plugins:

    unix://path/to/unix/socket.sock

Note: All UNIX endpoints SHALL end with `.sock`. See [gRPC Name Resolution](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md).  

This variable is REQUIRED.

#### Operational Recommendations

The Plugin Supervisor expects that a Plugin SHALL act as a long-running service vs. an on-demand, CLI-driven process.

Supervised plugins MAY be isolated and/or resource-bounded.

##### Logging

* Plugins SHOULD generate log messages to ONLY standard output and/or standard error.
  * In this case the Plugin Supervisor SHALL assume responsibility for all log lifecycle management.
* Plugin implementations that deviate from the above recommendation SHALL clearly and unambiguously document the following:
  * Logging configuration flags and/or variables, including working sample configurations.
  * Default log destination(s) (where do the logs go if no configuration is specified?)
  * Log lifecycle management ownership and related guidance (size limits, rate limits, rolling, archiving, expunging, etc.) applicable to the logging mechanism embedded within the Plugin.
* Plugins SHOULD NOT write potentially sensitive data to logs (e.g. `VolumeMetadata`).

##### Available Services

* Plugin Packages MAY support all or a subset of CSI services; service combinations MAY be configurable at runtime by the Plugin Supervisor.
* Misconfigured plugin software SHOULD fail-fast with an OS-appropriate error code.

##### Linux Capabilities

* Plugin Supervisor SHALL guarantee that plugins will have `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability on Linux when running on Nodes.
* Plugins SHOULD clearly document any additionally required capabilities and/or security context.

##### Namespaces

* A Plugin SHOULD NOT assume that it is in the same [Linux namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces) as the Plugin Supervisor.
  The CO MUST clearly document the [mount propagation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt) requirements for Node Plugins and the Plugin Supervisor SHALL satisfy the CO’s requirements.

##### Cgroup Isolation

* A Plugin MAY be constrained by cgroups.
* An operator or Plugin Supervisor MAY configure the devices cgroup subsystem to ensure that a Plugin may access requisite devices.
* A Plugin Supervisor MAY define resource limits for a Plugin.

##### Resource Requirements

* SPs SHOULD unambiguously document all of a Plugin’s resource requirements.
